🚀 𝑬𝒙𝒄𝒊𝒕𝒆𝒅 𝒕𝒐 𝑺𝒉𝒂𝒓𝒆 𝑴𝒚 Walmart  𝑷𝒓𝒐𝒋𝒆𝒄𝒕! 🚀


I’m thrilled to present my latest project on Walmart Sales Analysis using Power BI. This project explores key metrics, including the impact of weather conditions on sales, and provides data-driven recommendations for improving inventory management and overall sales performance🎯

Dataset overview🤔

Walmart is struggling to manage its inventory effectively across its many stores worldwide. The challenge is balancing stock levels—ensuring there’s enough inventory to meet customer demand without overstocking, which leads to excess costs, or understocking, which causes missed sales. External factors like weather and promotions further complicate this task


Tools and Technologies💻✨

To bring this analysis to life, I used Power BI, leveraging its robust capabilities to visualize and interpret the data. Here are the key technologies and techniques I employed:


🤹‍♂️ 𝐓𝐚𝐬𝐤𝐬 𝐏𝐞𝐫𝐟𝐨𝐫𝐦𝐞𝐝:

Power Query: For efficient data transformation and preparation.
DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): To create complex calculations and measures like:-(SelectedValue,Calculate,filter,Date,Cummulative).
Filter and Sorting: To organize the data for clearer insights.
Modeling: Data Modelling with two tables.
Create Parameters.


📈 𝐈𝐧𝐬𝐢𝐠𝐡𝐭𝐬:-

1.Product Performance: Among all product categories, TVs have generated the highest sales volume.

2.Payment Methods: While credit cards are the most commonly used payment method, digital wallets have contributed to the highest sales figures.

3.Customer Demographics: The 45-60 age group represents the largest customer segment and also drives higher sales compared to other age groups.

4.Category Performance: The electronics category consistently produces the highest sales figures.

5.Seasonal Trends: August saw the highest sales quantity with a total of 656 units sold, while September recorded the lowest sales volume.

6.Forecast Accuracy: The actual demand consistently exceeded the forecasted demand, indicating a positive sales growth trend beyond expectations.

7.Weather Impact: Sales performance tends to decline during rainy weather conditions.

8.Day of the Week Trends: Sales are typically lower on Fridays and Sundays, while Thursdays and Mondays exhibit the highest sales volumes.

9.Store Performance: The Los Angeles store generated the highest sales, while the Miami and New York stores underperformed in comparison.



💡 𝐑𝐞𝐜𝐨𝐦𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐝𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐬:

1.Optimize Inventory Distribution: Shift stock to stores with higher demand, such as high-sales areas like Los Angeles and California, while avoiding overstocking at lower-demand locations.

2.Adjust for Seasonal Trends: Reduce stock levels during rainy seasons, as sales typically decline during this period.

3.Target Younger Demographics: Focus on curating and promoting products that specifically appeal to the 18-30 age group, as this demographic generates the least sales, and could drive higher sales if targeted effectively.
